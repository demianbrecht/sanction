Changes
=======

sanction 0.4.1 (1-14-2014)
==========================
* Fixed string formatting for Python 2.6 

sanction 0.4 (8-21-2013)
==========================
* Breaking: token_transport parameter of Client.__init__ no longer accepts
  strings (which was weird to begin with). It only accepts callables.
  transport_headers and transport_query have been made public (well, the underscore
  prefix has been removed) in light of this.
* Breaking: scope is now expected to be formatted how the provider expects
  it. scope_delim has been removed from auth_uri in order to simplify it. This
  means that your providers' scope should be set accordingly: i.e. Facebook
  may be 'foo,bar' while Google would be 'foo bar'.
* Breaking: removed redirect_uri from Client.__init__ (didn't make sense to
  be there. This has been added to auth_uri and request_token.
* Deprecation: sanction.client.Client has been deprecated in favor of 
  sanction.Client. The deprecated version will likely be removed within 
  the next couple minor revisions.
* Feature: Added headers param to request
* Feature: Added with_patched_client test decorator
* Brought unit tests up to 100% coverage (yay!)
* Sphinx-ified the docs, added to RTD
* Removed Python 3.2 support (causes unit test breakage right now and I don't
  really want to spend more time on it ;)). The client code should work fine,
  it's just a test that doesn't pass right now.

sanction 0.3.1 (4-8-2013)
=========================
* Added refresh_token, defaulting to None instead of dynamically adding it
  to the client instance

sanction 0.3 (2-21-2013)
========================
* Python 3+ support added
* Updated request to support a full range of HTTP methods (was previously POST
  and GET
* Added support for multiple token transport types: HTTP headers, GET params
  or custom callable
* Added exclude param to request_token in order to prevent certain fields from
  token request
* Removed query param from request. These should now be added to the base url.

sanction 0.1.4 (9-14-2012)
==========================
* Added support for refresh_token
* Removed check for endpoint errors in request_token. Client code should 
  deal with that before calling request_token.
